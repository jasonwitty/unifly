## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- **Session expiry no longer kills a long-running TUI.** The session cookie
  lapses roughly an hour in; previously every Session-backed fetch (client
  details, health, events, NAT, firewall groups, Wi-Fi neighbours, switch
  ports) failed with "Session expired" from then on and the WebSocket never
  came back, because login only ever ran at connect. `SessionClient` now
  keeps the login credentials (`enable_reauth`) and on `SessionExpired`
  re-logs in once, refreshes the session cache, and retries the request;
  failed re-logins are rate-limited to one per 30 s. Stale cookies are
  cleared before the re-login and a login that returns no new cookie is
  reported as a failure rather than silently retried. The WebSocket reads its
  cookie from the session client on every reconnect, and a server-side clean
  close now waits the initial backoff instead of reconnecting immediately.

### Performance

- **TUI memory and idle CPU.** The dashboard used ~100 MB RSS at start and
  grew without bound overnight (250 MB+). Root cause was glibc per-thread
  malloc arena fragmentation fed by a full controller refresh every 10 s
  that parsed the entire `stat/device` / `stat/sta` / `rest/user` payloads
  into flattened `serde_json` maps on a one-worker-per-core tokio runtime.
  - The binary now builds its own tokio runtime: one worker for `tui`, two
    for CLI commands, `UNIFLY_WORKER_THREADS` (1-16) overrides both.
  - TUI full-refresh cadence is 60 s by default (was 10 s), configurable via
    `[defaults].tui_refresh_secs` or `unifly tui --refresh-secs N`
    (`UNIFI_TUI_REFRESH_SECS`). Live device stats and events still arrive
    over the WebSocket in hybrid/session auth.
  - `polling_interval_secs` is now honoured: when no WebSocket is available
    (API-key or cloud auth) the controller polls only per-device statistics
    from the Integration API every 10 s (30 s cloud), so the dashboard keeps
    moving without the full refresh. Previously the setting was unused.
  - WebSocket `device:sync` decode failures are logged (once at warn) instead
    of silently disabling live stats; all numeric fields accept number or
    string encodings.
  - Session models (`SessionDevice`, `SessionClientEntry`, `SessionUserEntry`)
    carry typed fields instead of a `#[serde(flatten)]` catch-all map; the
    switch-port commands fetch the raw record on demand.
  - WebSocket `device:sync` frames are parsed into a typed `DeviceSync`
    instead of retaining the raw JSON, coalesced into one store snapshot per
    second, and the event ring shrank from 1024 to 64 slots.
  - Session bodies decode from bytes without an intermediate UTF-8 `String`.
  - Dashboard traffic chart records one real sample per second (was four,
    with exponential smoothing interpolating between controller updates that
    arrive ~1/s). The chart still redraws on every 250 ms tick while focused,
    scrolling continuously by the fraction of the interval elapsed and
    holding the last real value out to "now", so motion is smooth without
    plotting invented points. Window is 60 samples (one minute).
- **Binary size.** Release builds use fat LTO, reqwest is built with
  `rustls-no-provider` so only `ring` is linked (aws-lc-rs removed), and 17
  unused dependencies were dropped (six ratatui widget crates, two panic
  handlers, `strum`, `arc-swap`, `async-stream`, `bytes`, `indicatif`,
  `bytesize`, `humantime`, `indexmap`, `flate2`, plus the unused
  `tracing-subscriber/json` feature). Stripped x86_64 binary: 22.0 MB → 18.2 MB.
  A new `release-small` cargo profile (`opt-level = "s"`) builds a 13.0 MB
  binary for low-power hosts at ~5% more TUI CPU.


### Added

- **Create commands print the created entity on stdout** in the requested
  `--output` format (`-o plain` emits the new ID), so pipelines can
  capture IDs directly: `unifly networks create ... -o json | jq -r .id`.
  Covers networks, wifi, firewall policies/zones/groups, NAT, ACL, DNS,
  traffic-lists, hotspot vouchers (codes included), and the VPN create
  surface (session records, with private keys and PSKs redacted). The
  human confirmation stays on stderr. `sites create` is unchanged: the
  controller returns no record.

- **TUI auto-reconnect**: a failed controller connection no longer leaves
  the dashboard dead. The data bridge retries with exponential backoff
  (2s doubling to a 30s cap, indefinitely), the status bar shows the
  attempt number while reconnecting, and `Ctrl+r` triggers an immediate
  manual retry when disconnected.
- **Switch port management as code**: `devices ports`, `devices ports-export`,
  and `devices port-set` cover the full per-port surface (mode, native VLAN,
  tagged VLANs, PoE, speed). `port-set --from-file` accepts a JSONC payload
  matching `ApplyPortsRequest` with splice semantics (ports omitted from the
  file keep their existing override; per-port `"reset": true` clears one).
  `ports-export` emits sparse JSONC by default and `--all` for first-time
  bootstrapping. `--with-clients` annotates `ports` output with connected
  clients, and `ports-export --with-clients` injects
  `// last-seen <ISO8601>: <mac>` comments before each port for git-diff
  drift detection on config-as-code repos.
- **`Client::switch_port`** populated from the session-side `sw_port` and
  merged onto integration-only clients via the hybrid join. `clients get`
  detail view shows the wired port when present.
- **`settings` top-level command**: `list / get <KEY> / set <KEY> / export`
  for site-level Session API settings.
- **Full VPN management surface**: `vpn site-to-site` CRUD; `vpn
  remote-access` CRUD plus `suggest-port` and `download-config <id>`; `vpn
  clients` CRUD; `vpn connections` list/get/restart for the legacy v2
  connection inventory; `vpn peers` list/get/create/update/delete plus
  `subnets`; `vpn magic-site-to-site` list/get; `vpn settings`
  list/get/set/patch with `teleport`, `magic-site-to-site`, `openvpn`, and
  `peer-to-peer` flag groups. Most write paths accept `--from-file` for
  declarative config.
- **TUI HyperChart widget** with tachyonfx-driven effects, an Octant Canvas
  bandwidth chart with live legend on the Stats screen, a rank column on
  ranked-bar lists, and a 160ms `fade_from_fg` transition between screens.
- **`--after-system` on `firewall policies create`** to place a newly
  created policy after system-defined rules in one step (previously only
  available on `reorder`).
- **`--from-file` shorthand fields** for firewall policies: `dst_ip`,
  `dst_port`, `src_ip`, `src_port`, `dst_network`, `src_network` in
  policy JSON files are now resolved into the canonical
  `source_filter`/`destination_filter` before submission. Combined IP +
  port filters correctly nest `portFilter` inside `ipAddressFilter`.
- **`firewall groups`** CRUD commands for managing port groups, address
  groups, and IPv6 address groups via the Session API (`rest/firewallgroup`).
  Supports `list` (with `--type` filter), `get`, `create`, `update`, and
  `delete`.
- **Port/address group references in firewall policies**: `--dst-port-group`,
  `--src-port-group`, `--dst-address-group`, `--src-address-group` CLI flags
  and corresponding `dst_port_group` / `dst_address_group` shorthand fields
  in `--from-file` JSON. Group names are resolved to `external_id` UUIDs at
  create/update time.
- **`config cloud-setup`** guided onboarding for Site Manager profiles with
  API key validation, console selection, site discovery, and profile writing
- **`cloud` command group** for Site Manager fleet visibility: `hosts`,
  `sites`, `devices`, `isp`, and `sdwan`
- **`cloud switch <site>`** to retarget the active cloud profile to a different
  controller site using connector-resolved site names, internal references, or
  UUIDs
- **Site Manager fleet client** in `unifly-api` with `nextToken` pagination
  and cloud rate-limit handling
- **Cloud host auto-resolution** for controller-bound Integration commands
  when a profile omits `host_id` but the API key can unambiguously identify
  a console
- **`vpn servers get <id>`** and **`vpn tunnels get <id>`** for full VPN
  detail views with subnet, port, peer address, IKE version, and raw fields
- **`vpn status`** for live IPsec security association status from the
  Session API `stat/ipsec-sa` endpoint
- **`vpn health`** for the VPN subsystem slice of `stat/health`
- **`wifi neighbors`** to list neighboring and rogue APs seen by your access
  points, including signal, channel, SSID, and observer AP MAC
- **`wifi channels`** to show per-radio regulatory channel availability from
  the Session API
- **`clients roams <mac>`** to surface a client's connection timeline from the
  v2 system-log endpoint
- **`clients wifi <ip>`** to show per-client Wi-Fi experience metrics such as
  signal/noise, `wifi_experience`, link rates, nearest neighbors, and uplink
  chain data

### Changed

- **Breaking for `unifly-api` consumers:** the lossy
  `From<DnsPolicyResponse> for DnsPolicy` impl is replaced by `TryFrom`,
  returning a typed `UnrecognizedDnsRecordType` error instead of
  mislabeling unknown record types as `ForwardDomain`.
- **Credential precedence reversed**: when both an explicit `api_key` (or
  `password`) is set in a profile's TOML config and a corresponding keyring
  entry exists, the explicit config value now wins. This is the opposite of
  the older behavior and makes headless and shared-machine workflows
  predictable. See PR #22.
- Cloud auth now works end-to-end in CLI, TUI settings, and onboarding:
  `auth_mode = "cloud"` preserves `host_id`, `host_id_env`, `api_key_env`,
  defaults the controller URL to `https://api.ui.com`, and forces strict TLS
- Config and auth error guidance now points to both `config init` for local
  controllers and `config cloud-setup` for Site Manager onboarding
- Cloud authentication failures now mention Site Manager RBAC and console
  access, instead of only local controller password guidance
- Enriched `vpn servers` and `vpn tunnels` list output with subnet, port,
  protocol, peer, and IKE visibility where the controller returns those
  fields
- **Renamed "legacy" nomenclature to "session" throughout.** The UniFi
  `/api/*` and `/v2/api/*` HTTP surface is not deprecated — Ubiquiti ships new
  functionality there regularly, and with the API-key discovery it is no
  longer even tied to cookie session auth. It is now consistently called the
  **Session API** in code, types, docs, and user-facing messages.
  - Rust: `legacy/` module → `session/`, `LegacyClient` → `SessionClient`,
    `LegacyClientEntry` / `LegacyDevice` / `LegacyEvent` / `LegacySite` /
    `LegacyAlarm` / `LegacyUserEntry` → `Session*`, `Error::LegacyApi` →
    `Error::SessionApi`, `require_legacy` → `require_session`,
    `has_legacy_access` → `has_session_access`, `legacy_prefix` →
    `session_prefix`, `ensure_legacy_access` → `ensure_session_access`.
  - Config: `auth_mode = "legacy"` → `auth_mode = "session"`. This is a
    breaking change to config files; update existing profiles by hand or run
    `unifly config init` to regenerate.
  - TUI: `AuthMode::Legacy` → `AuthMode::Session`; the onboarding wizard's
    auth mode picker now shows "Username / Password (Session API)".
  - CLI errors: "session expired or invalid credentials" is now
    "API key rejected..." or "session expired..." depending on the client's
    auth kind.
  - Docs: AGENTS.md, README.md, CHANGELOG.md, `skills/unifly/**`, and
    `docs/guide/**` updated to reflect the new nomenclature.
  - `EntityId::Legacy(String)` is **kept** — that variant names an ID
    format (MongoDB ObjectId string vs UUID), not the API surface.

### Fixed

- The `[defaults]` config fields `insecure` and `timeout` are now honored
  during profile resolution instead of being parsed and ignored. Precedence
  is CLI flags > env vars > profile > `[defaults]` > builtin. A profile's
  `ca_cert` beats an inherited `[defaults]` `insecure = true`, and
  `--insecure=false` / `UNIFI_INSECURE=false` explicitly re-enables
  verification over any profile or defaults setting (bare `--insecure`
  still means true).
- `config init` now asks whether the controller uses a self-signed
  certificate (defaulting yes for IPs, `.local`/`.lan`-style hosts, and
  single-label hostnames) and writes `insecure = true` into the profile,
  so the canonical UDM/UCG setup no longer produces a profile that fails
  TLS everywhere `-k` isn't passed.
- **NAT policies appear in `nat policies list` under session-only auth.**
  The session-only refresh snapshot omitted NAT entirely, so rules
  created and persisted on the controller were invisible to the list
  command while update and delete still worked against them.
- **DNS policies parse modern `*_RECORD` type tokens** (#27). Controllers
  send `A_RECORD`-style identifiers; the old short-name tables mislabeled
  every non-forward record as `ForwardDomain` with an empty value, and
  `dns create` / `dns update` emitted tokens the controller rejects. One
  canonical mapping now covers read and write, unknown record types are
  skipped with a warning instead of mislabeled, and the CLI shows short
  DNS names (`A`, `CNAME`, `Forward`).
- **Firewall policy lists survive real controller payloads** (#26). Port
  ranges arrive as `start`/`stop` per Ubiquiti's OpenAPI spec; the model
  demanded invented `startPort`/`endPort` names, and one failing policy
  blanked the entire list. Integration list pages now also decode
  per-item, so a single unparseable record can never empty a collection,
  and pagination advances by the server-reported wire count so dropped
  items cannot truncate a scan.
- **The TUI honors CLI flag and env overrides** (#25). The profile path
  dropped `--insecure`, `--site`, `--api-key`, `--totp`, `--no-cache`,
  and `--controller`, so `UNIFI_INSECURE=true unifly tui -k` failed TLS
  against self-signed certs while the CLI worked; connect failures now
  show the reason in the status bar instead of a silent "disconnected".
- **Profile `timeout` takes effect.** The `--timeout` flag's baked-in
  clap default made every profile timeout dead weight; resolution now
  follows flag/env, then profile, then the 30-second default, including
  cloud transports.
- Port range items in firewall policy payloads now serialize as
  `PORT_NUMBER_RANGE` instead of `PORT_RANGE`, which the UDM API rejects.
  `PORT_RANGE` is still accepted on read for backward compatibility.
